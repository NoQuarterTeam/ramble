    "country": "Cornwall",
    "abstract": "<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">During the 1990s the last water vole record from Cornwall was confirmed before the species became locally extinct. It is believed that habitat loss and fragmentation reduced and disconnected their populations, which was then followed by predation by escapes and releases of non-native American mink. This invasive rapidly caused the demise of the already dwindling populations across all river catchment in the region.\u00a0 </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Water voles can have a profound effect on local ecosystems in several ways. They eat up to 80% of their body weight per day and reproduce rapidly, with females having up to 4 or 5 litters per year. This leads to a population boom during the breeding season, and they act as a prey base for many other species during this time. Weighing up to 10 times more than other species of vole, they are efficient prey for these other species, such as barn owl, heron, fox and otter, and their availability can improve the ability of these other species to survive and reproduce. Water vole grazing behaviour can also increase plant diversity. They have been recorded eating up to 227 different plant species, and this means that succession can be slowed, and the area does not become dominated by fewer species. Finally, water voles can create large multi-chambered burrows, used for shelter and breeding. These burrows dry out the soil and change nitrogen levels within it, which can also improve plant diversity. Amphibians and reptiles have also been recorded sheltering within disused burrows.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0</span></p>\n",

To reach this goal, bovines and Przewalski\u2019s horses were introduced to create a relatively diverse grazing community. The area is a typical grassland and has a semiarid-continental four-season climate. Within the reserve the large grazers are kept in semi-wild conditions, there is no interference with their movement within the reserve or their social bonds, surplus food or water is usually not offered. Notably, the fence inhibits the migration of large herbivores, but does not isolate the area in other aspects, wild animals (e.g. rabbits, foxes, and roe deer) can easily cross the fences. Since the establishment of the reserve, both the Przewalski\u2019s horse population and the cattle population successfully adapted to the new environment and grew rapidly. Because of the lack of apex predator the population number needs to be managed. Cattle are considered domestic animals, though the aim is to breed animals that resembles to the ancient aurochs both appearance and behaviour (strong vitality, easy calving, etc.).</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To understand the effect of large grazers on the grassland a wide monitoring work was started recently.

    "abstract": "<div class=\"ewa-rteLine\">Natural grazing by feral bovines was once prevalent on the dunes, moors and marshes of the French south-west coast. Historically, local people would go to the dunes every the spring to collect calves for their various needs (traction, meat, etc.). These feral bovines were of a local breed known as the &#8220;marine landaise&#8221;, which is phenotypically close to traditional breeds of south-west Europe such as the Monchina, Aubrac, etc. During the 19th century, the development of large industrial pine plantations (Pinus pinaster) has deeply changed habitats and landscapes (with soil drainage, coastal dunes fixation) and local people lost access to grazing commons. These deep changes in the area&#8217;s ecosystems and social practices (including hunting, tree plantation management, associated laws) led to the widespread elimination of the feral animals.</div>\n<div class=\"ewa-rteLine\"></div>\n<div class=\"ewa-rteLine\">SEPANSO, which manages a nature reserve around a coastal lagoon behind the dune system (Etant de Cousseau) has been experimenting the restoration of natural grazing with this breed since 1990 when it purchased the last group of Marine Landaise with the help of WWF France. Genetically &#8220;Reinforced&#8221; by the introgression of a few external genes (in particular with a male of the Monchina race imported from the Spanish Basque Country), this breed was redeveloped as a rustic grazer on the Nature Reserve and on other regional partners&#8217; sites when the reserve&#8217;s carrying capacity was judged to be exceeded. The reserve is seeking to grow the area under natural grazing by working with neigbouring forest owners (both public and private), on sandy soils and moors, which is necessary to grow the herd and enable it to fully play its role in the more productive marsh.</div>\n<div class=\"ewa-rteLine\"></div>\n<div class=\"ewa-rteLine\">The SEPANSO (manager of the reserve) and the Aquitaine Breeds Conservatory jointly assume the administrative and genetic responsibility for this breed, which was identified and recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2018. Our natural grazing initiative therefore serves two purposes: natural grazing in the reserve, and the conservation of the rare breed.</div>\n",

In 2019 the Central European Breeding Centre Tetrijeb was officially opened, which includes a large pre-release aviary measuring 80m x 80m was built to prepare capercaillie, in an effort to eventually release them into the wild.</p>\n<p>In addition to breeding and tracking capercaillie, through their aviary they aim to show this mysterious and timid species to bird lovers. They are developing nature based economies in the area through wildlife photography of capercaillie from the aviary observatory. Additionally, they organize visits to the natural sights in the surrounding areas, and organize accommodation with meals in the immediate vicinity.</p>\n",

The horses are healthy, reproduce successfully and live a long life, while doing any kind of harness (draught) or horse-riding work in arduous conditions. Due to the active intensification, including mechanization, of agriculture and the drive for high production indicators in animal husbandry, some local breeds traditionally used by the population appeared to be on the verge of extinction. As a result, the Polesskaya horse population has now reached its critical status of \u201cdisappearing\u201d due to a rapid decrease in its number. All these years, no targeted breeding work was carried out, but the horse population has survived to our times.</p>\n<p>The main project goal is to return the Polesskaya horse population to the conditions of its free habitation with limited human interference and ensuring not only the breeding and conservation of the local breed, but also the restoration of ecosystems of floodplain meadows prone to overgrowing. The Polesskaya horse is unpretentious, capable of independent existence (in cases where feeding in winter time is provided), and this makes it a promising breed for resettlement with a view of restoring and maintaining such ecosystems \u2015 a habitat of unique plant and endangered animal species. The Republican Biological Nature Reserve \u201cSporovsky\u201d (Beryoza District, Brest Region) is considered to be the place for the Polesskaya horse introduction into natural areas.</p>\n",

Along the river, tidal nature is subject to the full range from sea water to fresh water, resulting in a broad variety of habitats. The marshlands, maintained by large herbivores are popular breeding grounds for birds such as little bittern, blue throat, marsh harrier and common bittern.

It once ranged throughout the lowlands of Europe, with the last wild populations, in Poland\u2019s Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest and the northern Caucasus, becoming extinct by 1927. They have since been reintroduced from captivity into several European countries, with all animals being descendants of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca or lowland European bison. Today, in the West Pomeranian region, the population of European bison is small, isolated and of low genetic diversity. Furthermore, growth in the population takes place without a corresponding increase in the area of occurrence, with low social acceptance being a key factor blocking the growth and expansion of the population.</p>\n<p>The project is addressing the problems of low genetic diversity and population growth of European bison in and between Natura 2000 network sites in north-western Poland. The main objectives are to create a model for bison population management in an area of intensive human economic activity, and to increase the European bison population from the existing 110 to at least 190 individuals. The project is also initiating a corresponding increase in the area for bison habitat by at least 30%, with a decrease in the average seasonal bison density per area unit. The project\u2019s specific objectives are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new herd of bison in between the existing ones and, as a result, to increase the genetic diversity of the population and facilitate genetic exchange between herds;</li>\n<li>Improve the European bison feeding basis in the expanded area;</li>\n<li>Create a bison support unit as a system tool for population management;</li>\n<li>Introduce measures to reduce bison damage to forests and crops;</li>\n<li>Improve the safety of animals through the dissemination of information on their current habitat areas; and</li>\n<li>Improve public awareness, so that friendly local community attitudes help the herds to develop, and to transfer positive patterns of attitude into new areas.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Marker Wadden will boost biodiversity in the Netherlands. The project is\u00a0aiming to restore an area of up to 100 square kilometres.</p>\n<p>One of the largest freshwater lakes in western Europe, the Markermeer is a shallow lake with a depth of between 3 and 5 metres. It used to be part of the Zuiderzee, a saltwater inlet of the North Sea, which was dammed off in 1932.</p>\n<p>Following the abandonment of a land reclamation project in the 1980s, the Markermeer became a valuable ecological and recreational asset. The lake is a Natura 2000 site, and an important breeding, resting and wintering habitat for numerous bird species. It is also home to wide range of fish species, on which many bird species depend.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the biodiversity of Markermeer has declined drastically over the last few decades. Due to the separation of the lake by dykes, sediment which was once carried away on currents now falls to the bottom of the lake, making the water turbid and negatively impacting fish and bird populations, as well as plants and molluscs.</p>\n<p>The eventual aim of the Marker Wadden project, which began in 2014, is to create a 10,000-hectare archipelago of islands in the lake, using the fine sediment from the lake bottom. In a groundbreaking approach, a consortium of Dutch companies, including hydraulic engineering company\u00a0<a href=\"https://boskalis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boskalis</a>\u00a0and the Department of Public Works of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/english\">Rijkswaterstaat</a>, are using ring dykes of sand to contain the sediment.</p>\n<p>Facilitating the restoration of up to 100 square kilometres of lake, Marker Wadden\u2019s archipelago of islands will provide a wide range of valuable habitats and solve the problem of siltation by changing water dynamics and creating deeper gullies where suspended silt can settle out. By improving water quality, this will also help to regenerate ecological productivity, boosting ecosystem functioning and benefiting many species of birds, fish and macrofauna. It will also benefit recreational activities on the lake.</p>\n<p>Government funding is vital to the success of Marker Wadden, with the overall cost of the project estimated to be around \u20ac300 million. Construction of one island of 250 hectares has already been completed, while financing for the next four islands (representing the first project phase of 1000 hectares) has already been secured.</p>\n<p>The Marker Wadden project, which will transform a large inland water body with poor ecological functioning into a lake teeming with life above and below the water, is a great example of a nature-based solution using rewilding principles. It\u2019s a win-win for wild nature and man!</p>\n",

While many of these rivers have been dammed, others provide anglers with some of the best fishing in northern Europe. Yet even on undammed waterways, a variety of anthropogenic factors have negatively impacted fish migration. Rivers such as the 210 kilometre-long R\u00e5ne and 400 kilometre-long Pite today witness annual runs of salmon and sea trout that are far less than their natural carrying capacity. Working in collaboration with fishing associations on both the R\u00e5ne and Pite, Rewilding Lapland is now working hard to boost fish migration, through activities such as spawning ground restoration and the removal of artificial obstacles. Sonar-based fish counters are used on both rivers to measure results. In Sweden\u2019s first ever fishing management system, the R\u00e5ne River Fishing Association \u2013 a collection of 275 land owners that rents fishing rights \u2013 now employs a strict catch-and-release policy, and has imposed a complete ban on fishing in the river at certain times of year. A similar approach has been taken on the Pite, which is renowned for its salmon, sea trout and grayling. Together with river restoration, Rewilding Lapland is exploring new nature-based business opportunities, providing support to enterprises involved in fishing and otter watching on the lower R\u00e5ne.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Furthermore, Rewilding Europe is working with Rewilding Lapland and local partners to support guided reindeer migration, raising awareness of these threats and supporting Sami communities in their fight for traditional grazing rights. The aim is the full protection of all remaining old-growth forests, combined with the adoption of reindeer-adapted forestry and the elimination of mining threats to key reindeer wintering areas.\u00a0By collaborating with Sami communities to develop wildlife watching businesses and guided reindeer tourism, the Rewilding Lapland team and partners are working to grow a local nature-based economy and reduce human-wildlife conflict. Raising Sami income from wildlife watching will hopefully contribute to greater acceptance and protection of local wild nature, including an increased tolerance of the presence of large carnivores.</p>\n<div class=\"row sideImageRow\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row sideImageRow\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n",

As a pilot of the far larger (5000 hectare)\u00a0<a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/news/gelderse-poort-river-restoration-is-a-rewilding-showcase-for-europe/\">Gelderse Poort</a>\u00a0project (itself one of the most innovative rewilding initiatives of our times) which has provided more space for the River Waal in the Nijmegen area\u00a0and led to its ecological recovery, the 600-hectare Millingerwaard site demonstrates perfectly how both people and wild nature can benefit when natural processes are given free rein to reshape landscapes.</p>\n<p>In response to concerns about flooding, climate change and unsustainable agriculture, a new vision for Dutch rivers was conceived in the mid-1980s. Called \u201cPlan Stork\u201d, it proposed an ecologically restored riverine landscape governed by natural hydrological and morphological processes. This plan was later elaborated on and scaled up in successive programmes, firstly called \u201cLiving Rivers\u201d and then \u201cRoom for Rivers\u201d (which now encompasses the rivers IJssel, Lek, Maas and Waal). Millingerwaard was the test bed for these ideas.</p>\n<p>Starting in the early 90s, Millingerwaard\u2019s waterways were restructured so that floodplains were once again able to play their natural role in flood protection. Clay mining became a new economic driver, partially replacing agriculture. Newly excavated channels contributed to the ecological restoration of the riverine landscape, boosting its flood prevention capacity and improving water quality.</p>\n<p>As a result of these activities, today the Millingerwaard is both ecologically and economically transformed. About three hundred hectares have been turned into a nature reserve, now integrated into a far greater rewilded area and owned by various parties such as Staatsbosbeheer (the Dutch Forestry Department), Delgromij (a clay extraction company), and De Beijer (a brick factory). These partners have been developing the Millingerwaard in collaboration with ARK Nature since 1993.</p>\n<p>As natural processes have reshaped the Millingerwaard landscape, so stretches of riparian forest have developed, with trees that occasionally dip their feet in water. Marshes, herb-rich grasslands, lakes and river dunes have also evolved, each with their own diverse ecosystems of animals and plants.</p>\n<p>Free-roaming herds of Galloway cattle and Konik horses now graze the floodplains of the Millingerwaard year-round, contributing to the creation of a mosaic landscape. Beavers, otters, badgers, great white egrets, white-tailed eagles, black terns, bluethroats, skylarks and corncrakes all call the area home, while species such as osprey and black stork are also regularly spotted. During the winter, tens of thousands of geese frequently gather here.</p>\n",
